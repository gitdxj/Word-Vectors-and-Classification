    "Read the data to a pandas dataframe from `complaints.csv`; this is a rather large file of 206MB. Keep only the `Consumer complaint narrative` (input text) and `product`(labels). Remove the missing values, rename `Consumer complaint narrative` to `Narrative` for ease of use, and add a column encoding the product as an integer. This will represent your labels for classification and the mapping will be used later on. Create two dictionaries: one mapping the ids to products and one mapping products to their ids."
